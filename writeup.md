# Create a Tableau Story Titanic Data
[Tableau Story from Titanic Data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/byungcheon.ko#!/vizhome/TitanicSurvival_8/SurvivalStory)
## Summary
Titanic data contains demographics and passenger information from a subset of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. I will create a visualization that shows the demographics or passenger information between those passengers who survived and those who died.

## Design
* I looked at how each factor(Gender, Ticket Class, Age Group, Embarked from) affect survival rate of the passenger. 
* I used a bar graph to show the difference. 

## Feedback
* In Survived visualization, display AVG(Survived) instead of SUM(Survived)
* In Age visualization, group ages
* In Embarked visualization, remove Null value
* In Survived visualization, change 0 to dead and 1 to alive
* In Pclass visualization, display AVG(Survived) instead of SUM(Survived)
