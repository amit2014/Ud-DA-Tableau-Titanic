# Ud-DAND-Tableau-TitanicData
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project : Create a Tableau Story - Titanic Data

## Project Overview
For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### What do I need to install?
Before working on the project, you will need to have either Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop installed. You will need a software license to use Tableau Desktop. If you don't have one, you can download Tableau Public HERE.

### Why this Project?
This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:

* visualization is a dialog
* showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
* visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements

You will have an opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.

### What will I learn?
After completing the project, you will be able to:

* Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
* Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
* Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau

### Why is this Important to my Career?
Data analyst are storytellers that can translate data findings that other people can easily understand. They view data visualization as an important form of communication.

If you, as a data analyst, can create visualizations to explore data, articulate clear findings to drive business decisions, or use data to elicit consensus from diverse perspectives, then you will be a deeply invaluable member on your team.

## Project Details
For the final project, you will create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, and your final deliverable will be a write up along with a Tableau Public workbook.

We will provide some options of data sets to explore; however, you may choose to explore an entirely different data set. You should be aware that finding your own data set and cleaning it using Python, R, or some other language can take considerable time and effort. This can add as much as a day, a week, or even months to your project so embark on the adventure to find and clean a data set if you are truly prepared with data wrangling skills.

You have three options for this project. You should pick an option based on your prior experience with data munging and exploratory data analysis. The option you choose will not affect the evaluation of the project.

* **Option 1**: Select one of the beginner data sets, which already has a summary of findings, from the [Data Set Options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7KhqotVi5eoKE3I_AZHbsxdr-NmcWsLTIiZrpxWx4w/pub?embedded=true) document. Then, create a visualization that communicates the findings.
* **Option 2**: Select one of the intermediate data sets from the [Data Set Options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7KhqotVi5eoKE3I_AZHbsxdr-NmcWsLTIiZrpxWx4w/pub?embedded=true) document. You will investigate the data set to share a story or message about the data and then create a suitable visualization.
* **Option 3**: Find a data set, investigate it, and share your findings in a visualization. Your final graphic should primarily be explanatory, but it may also contain exploratory components. You can find a list of recommended websites to find data sets in the [Data Set Options](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w7KhqotVi5eoKE3I_AZHbsxdr-NmcWsLTIiZrpxWx4w/pub?embedded=true) document. You should be aware that finding your own data set, cleaning the data set, and analyzing it (using R, iPython Notebook, or another tool) can take considerable time and effort. This can lengthen the time you spend on your project by days, weeks, or even months. Choose the option only if you feel prepared for a challenge!
Now, on to the details!
